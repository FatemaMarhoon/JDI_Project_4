Great choice with the "Volunteer Matching Platform"! Here's a tailored README.md draft to get you started:

# Volunteer Matching Platform

## Overview

The **Volunteer Matching Platform** is a web-based system that connects volunteers with opportunities that match their skills and interests. Built with a robust backend using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and following a monolithic architecture, the platform provides a secure, scalable environment for managing volunteer activities. The platform aims to make volunteering easier by streamlining the process of finding opportunities, signing up, and tracking contributions, thus fostering a culture of community service.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register as volunteers or organizations. Authentication is managed using JWT for secure access to protected resources.
  
- **Opportunity Management**: Organizations can create, update, and manage volunteer opportunities, while volunteers can browse, search, and apply for opportunities that suit their skills and schedule.
  
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different user roles, such as "Volunteer" and "Organization", are supported, ensuring users only access features relevant to them.
  
- **Email Verification**: Users must verify their email before they can access the platform to ensure authenticity.
  
- **Password Management**: The platform includes password recovery, password change, and secure storage of user credentials.
  
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles with personal details and preferences, including uploading profile pictures.
  
- **Volunteer Tracking**: Volunteers can view their contribution history, including hours spent and opportunities they've participated in.
  
- **File Uploads**: Organizations can upload documents, such as event guidelines or consent forms, related to volunteer opportunities.
  
- **Soft Delete for Users**: When an admin user deletes a volunteer, it is a soft delete, changing the user status to inactive rather than removing their data from the system.

- **Search and Filtering**: Volunteers can search for opportunities by location, skill requirement, or cause.
  
- **Third-party Integration**: Integrate with third-party APIs to fetch events from external sources like non-profits or volunteer databases (as a bonus feature).

## Tools and Technologies

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security** (JWT)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Tomcat**
- **Docker**
- **JUnit, MockMvc** (for TDD)
- **Lombok** (for simplifying Java code)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

## Development Approach

The project follows the **Test Driven Development (TDD)** methodology, ensuring that each feature is first tested using unit and integration tests before the actual implementation. Docker is used to containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments, with separate containers for the database and the backend application.

The backend will be structured in compliance with the **MVC** architecture, ensuring separation of concerns between the models, controllers, and services.

## User Stories

1. **As a volunteer**, I want to easily find and apply for volunteer opportunities that match my interests and availability.
2. **As an organization**, I want to post volunteer opportunities, manage applications, and track volunteer participation.
3. **As an admin**, I want to manage users, opportunities, and ensure the integrity of the platform.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

(Attach your ERD diagram here, outlining the relationships between users, opportunities, roles, applications, etc.)

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FatemaMarhoon/java-capstone-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd java-capstone-project
   ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Now, you can modify and elaborate on this depending on how your project evolves. Letâ€™s also work on your ERD. You can describe your entities like **User**, **Opportunity**, **Application**, and their relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.).
